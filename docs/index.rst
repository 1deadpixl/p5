p5 provides high level drawing functionality to help you quickly
create simulations and interactive art using Python. p5 combines the
core ideas of `Processing <https://processing.org/>`_ — i.e., learning
to code in a visual context — with Python's readibilty to make
programming more accessible to beginners, educators, and artists.

The p5 documentation is organized into the following sections:

- :doc:`Tutorials <tutorials/index>` take you through a series of
  steps to create multiple p5 sketches and introduce you to the most
  common features. Ideally you should start here if you have never
  worked with Processing and/or p5.

- :doc:`Guides <guides/index>` provide background information on p5
  concepts and discuss topics at a high level. The guides **do not**
  have step-by-step instructions and assume a basic understanding of
  p5.

- The :doc:`Reference <reference/index>` provides a detailed overview
  of the complete p5 API.

Make sure to read through the :doc:`Quickstart <quickstart>` and
:doc:`Installation <install>` pages to get started. If have programmed
in Processing before, you should also take a look at the :doc:`p5 for
Processing users <guides/for-processing-users>` guide.

If you would like to report a bug, request additional features, or
would like to help out, please take a look at the `CONTRIBUTING
<https://github.com/p5py/p5/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst>`_ file on
