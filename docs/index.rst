p5 provides high level drawing functionality to help you quickly
create simulations and interactive art using Python. p5 combines the
core ideas of `Processing <https://processing.org/>`_ — i.e., learning
to code in a visual context — with Python's readibilty to make
programming more accessible to beginners, educators, and artists.

The p5 documentation is organized into the following sections:

- :doc:`Tutorials <tutorials/index>` take you through a series of
  steps to create multiple p5 sketches and introduce you to the most
  common features. Start here if you have never worked with Processing
  and/or p5.

- :doc:`Guides <guides/index>` provide background information on p5
  concepts and discuss topics at a high level.

- :doc:`Reference <reference/index>` provides a detailed overview of
  the p5 API.

Make sure to read through the `Quickstart <quickstart>`_ page to get
started. If have programmed in Processing before, you should take a
look at the `p5 for Processing users` guide.

If you would like to report a bug, request additional features, or
would like to help out, please take a look at the `CONTRIBUTING
<https://github.com/p5py/p5/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst>`_ file on
the `project repository on Github <https://github.com/p5py/p5/>`_.
